            <dd>
                <b>Ingredients: </b><br>
                500 grams white all-purpose flour <br>
                1 sachet regular active dry yeast (2.25 tsp) <br>
                1 tbsp olive oil <br>
                pinch of salt <br>
                <b>Ingredients for filling:</b><br>
                pitted black olives<br>
                1-2 russet potatoes<br>
                eggs<br>
                harissa<br>
                tuna, drained<br>
                parsley<br>
                <b>Preparation:</b><br>
                Assemble all ingredients in a stand mixer.<br>
                Turn on and slowly pour 1 cup of lukewarm water to bring dough together.<br>
                If necessary, add more water, a little at a time. (You can also do the mixing step by hand in a bowl.)<br>
                After you’ve assembled your dough, put in a bowl. <br>
                Rub olive oil over the top of the ball then cover and let rest 1-2 hours until it doubles in size.<br>
                <em>Meanwhile:</em><br>
                Boil water in a large saucepan and place eggs in. Remove after 10 minutes and rinse under cold water.<br>
                Peel when cool and slice. <br>
                (If you prefer a jammier egg, you can remove it from the boiling water after 7-8 minutes.)<br>
                Boil water and cook russet potatoes until soft/tender but still holding their shape. <br>
                Drain under cold water and once cool, dice them into small squares.<br>
                When dough has risen, roll out on flat surface with a rolling pin.<br>
                Cut out circles using a round cookie-cutter (3-3.5” in diameter) or hand form them.<br>
                Then shape individual circles into ovals (2.5-3”). <br>
                Cover with a damp towel and let rest again for at least 10-15 min.<br>
                Heat your neutral cooking oil (canola or vegetable) in a deep pot. <br>
                Once the oil is hot, gently place the dough in the pot.<br>
                (Don’t overcrowd it, so be sure to do in batches.) <br>
                Let each piece of dough get golden-brown and puffed up on one side before flipping over and letting it <br>
                do the same on the other side.Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon and place on a rack or paper <br>
                towel-lined baking sheet.Repeat with remaining dough. Once cooked, take a serrated knife and slice down<br>
                the long side of the oval without cutting all the way through <br>
                (so it’s still in one piece like a sandwich roll or hotdog bun).Spread harissa on one (or both!) sides.<br>
                Fill with the potatoes, sliced hard-boiled egg, tuna, pitted black olives, and finely chopped parsley.Enjoy!<br>
