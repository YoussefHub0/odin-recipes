            <dt>Tunisian mloukhia Recipe</dt>
            <dd>
                <b>Ingredients: </b><br>
                1 packet of mloukhia (100g) <br>
                neutral cooking oil<br>
                3-4 bay leaves<br>
                1.25 lamb shoulder chop (bone-in)<br>
                2 tablespoons tabil<br>
                1 tsp caraway<br>
                1-2 tbsp homemade harissa (harissa arabi) and/or 1 tbsp tomato paste<br>
                3 garlic cloves<br>
                <b>Preparation</b><br>
                Take the packet of mloukhia and place the contents in a large cooking pot on the stove.<br>
                Add about 2 cups of neutral cooking oil. Mix and stir to get the lumps out.<br>
                Then add about 2 liters of hot/boiling water but leave room at the top of the pot.<br>
                Bring to a boil on med/high heat. Add bay leaves, then turn down pot to a low simmer and cover<br>
                for about 2 hours.<br>
                <b>Meanwhile:</b><br>
                Prepare the meat. (You can also do this the night before.) In a small bowl, mix tabil, caraway,<br>
                harissa/tomato paste, ground pepper, and a pinch of salt. <br>
                Then mash the garlic cloves to a paste in a mortar and pestle (or finely chop with a knife)<br>
                and add to the other spices. Place lamb in a larger bowl and rub the spice mixture into the meat<br>
                with a spoon. Cover and refrigerate (you can prepare this the day ahead and refrigerate overnight).<br>
                After two hours, turn mloukhia pot back up and let it boil, then add the lamb in.<br>
                Let it boil for a bit then turn down heat and let it simmer on low (for ~1.5-2 hours).<br>
                At this point, the meat should be tender and starting to fall off the bone. The minute the water<br>
                hits the mloukhia, it has a slimy consistency. The only way to get rid of this is to let it<br>
                cook for a long time. (Total cooking time: ~3.5-5 hours) Serve with baguette and enjoy!<br>
