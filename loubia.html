                <b>Ingredients: </b><br>
                ½ medium onion chopped <br>
                8-11 small/medium gloves of garlic, peeled<br>
                2 tbs ras el hanout spice mix<br>
                1-2 tsp salt<br>
                ½- ¾ cup oil<br>
                ½ of a 6 oz can of tomato paste<br>
                1 tbs paprika (can also use ½ tsp each of paprika and cayenne)<br>
                1 tsp black pepper <br>
                8 medium pieces of lamb (type of cut based on your preference)<br>
                4 cups of water<br>
                2 Anaheim peppers<br>
                1 poblano pepper<br>
                3 15-oz cans of white beans (We used Great Northern beans.<br>
                You can also use Cannelloni or white kidney beans or you can use dry beans and soak them over night.)<br>
                <b>Preparation</b><br>
                In a mortar and pestle, mash together the ras el hanout, garlic, and a pinch of salt. <br>
                In a large pot, heat the oil over medium heat, add the onion and garlic and spice mixture, <br>
                paprika (and cayenne if using it), salt, black pepper, and tomato paste, and saute for a few <br>
                minutes until all mixed and fragrant. If it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan at all, add a <br>
                little bit of water and keep sautéing.<br>
                Add the meat and saute for several minutes as well to slightly sear the outside.<br>
                Add enough water to fully cover the meat; we used 4 cups total.<br>
                Bring to a boil, cover the pot with the lid, and turn the heat down to low and allow to simmer <br>
                until the meat is nearly fully cooked (about an hour depending on the size of the pieces of <br>
                meat). <br>
                Add the whole peppers and the drained beans and cook for another 15-20 minutes or until the beans <br>
                are all heated through and the meat is tender. <br>
                Ladle up a bowl and serve with fresh baguette. <br>
